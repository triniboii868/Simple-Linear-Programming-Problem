# Simple-Linear-Programming-Problem

## The Model 

This simple linear programming model determines the ideal position for hire over the peak period, between <br>
August 30th - January 30th. The model compares two positions, the delivery driver and the driver associate <br>
Three constraints were taken into consideration with the development of this model, namely:

- Hourly wage
- Number of hours allowed to work
- Holiday hours per peak period

The model provides insight as to what the optimal number of hours for each position is and the amount of <br>
holiday hours each position is entitled to. In addition it calculates the cost of hiring a delivery driver <br>
and driver associate, and conclusively calculates the difference between them and outputs the cheaper option. <br>
This is ideal for the company to understand which position is worth hiring while maximizing profits.
